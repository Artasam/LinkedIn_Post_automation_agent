tools/history_tool.py
---------------------
Post History Tracker — prevents the agent from repeating a topic.

Saves a rolling log of the last 30 published post topics to post_history.json.
Before topic selection the agent calls filter_fresh_topics() which loads the
history ONCE and filters the entire list in a single pass — not once per article.

Performance fix: history file is loaded ONCE per filter operation,
not once per article (which caused 26 redundant file reads in logs).
