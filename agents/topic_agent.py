agents/topic_agent.py
---------------------
Topic Agent: Fetches trending AI topics from 6 sources, ranks by
relevance, filters history, and uses LLM to select LinkedIn-optimised
topics — preferring practitioner-relevant over pure academic content.

Key improvement: topics are translated from academic paper titles into
LinkedIn-friendly angles before passing to the content agent.
